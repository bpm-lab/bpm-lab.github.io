&lt;p&gt;Educama was founded in 2016 in the context of a research cooperation between Reutlingen University and NovaTec Consulting GmbH.
Educama aims at being a playground for people interested in current business process technology and targets several interest groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, we work on a showcase in the area of air freight transport. We have chosen this area, since it is a complex domain containing many knowledge-intense processes, where well established methods like BPMN are most likely to fail on their own. Instead, we want to tackle the area with Case Management and the corresponding modelling language CMMN at the core of our implementation.
Open questions that should be answered alongside the software development (again, list is not exhaustive):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the current specification of CMMN and its corresponding implementation by Camunda sufficient to create software for a real world project with knowledge-intense processes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are agile development methods applicable to model-based software development?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the BPM trilogy BPMN / CMMN / DMN behave in a real world scenario?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to design an optimal Case UI?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is a microservice architecture feasible for this kind of application and how does this work in a task- / process-based application?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
